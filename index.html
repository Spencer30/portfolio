      <div class="block">
        <h3>Back Story</h3>
        <p>
          I grew up in Kansas City and went to the University of Missouri for
          college. After college, I left Kansas City for the East Coast. I
          landed in Philadelphia where I worked in the investment accounting
          industry. After 7+ years in the investment accounting industry and a
          run at entrepreneurship, my experiences have led me to become a
          software developer. I found more passion in coding than I have with
          any other industry. I love problem solving and coding has given me the
          chance to expand on those skills.
        </p>
        <h3>LauchCode Graduate</h3>
        <p>
          I graduated from LaunchCode's LC101 program this past March and just
          finished their LiftOff program in June. LaunchCode is a national
          nonprofit offering free tech education and job placement
          opportunities. Their goal is to bring new people from all backgrounds
          into the tech field and reshape the way employers think about hiring.
          LaunchCode is highly competitive. The amount of value and education
          the program offers is exceptional and I'm very thankful to get that
          experience. My goal is to take my knowledge and apply it to the real
          world.
        </p>
        <h3>Ready To Work</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently seeking a role as a full time developer. My strength is
          with JavaScript, so I would love to work with React or Node but eager
          to learn other frameworks and languages. I enjoy working in small
          teams and in a collaborative environment where ideas and thoughts are
          shared freely to solve problems. My business background has given me
          the chance to see both sides of the equation between business and
          technology teams. I understand the high cost that comes with breakdown
          of communication between the two. I believe I can help fill those gaps
          and make sure challenges from both sides are communicated effectively.
